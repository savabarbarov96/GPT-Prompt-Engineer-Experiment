Tic Tac Toe Game Created with AI-Prompted Engineering

This Tic Tac Toe game was created using AI-prompted engineering in just three hours. Despite the time constraints, we were able to implement several features that make this game engaging and fun to play.
Features

Here are the features that we were able to implement:

    Grid Lines: We created a 3x3 grid to play Tic Tac Toe, with clearly visible grid lines to help players distinguish the individual squares.

    Player Turns: The game is designed to allow players to take turns playing X and O.

    Winning Logic: The game is equipped with a built-in logic that can detect when a player has won or when the game is tied.

    Animation: We added animations to make the gameplay more interesting and engaging.

    Text Effects: The game is equipped with text effects, including a shadow effect and text scaling.

    Blur Effect: When the game ends, the background is blurred for a cool effect.

    Play Again Button: At the end of the game, a "Play Again" button appears, allowing the user to restart the game with one click.

    Executable File: We have made the game into an executable file so that it can be played easily without any installations.

Usage

To play the game, simply run the executable file. The game will open in a window, and you can begin playing. To mark a square, simply click on it with your mouse. The game will automatically detect whose turn it is, and will also detect if a player has won or if the game is tied.

If you want to restart the game, simply click on the "Play Again" button at the end of the game. This will reset the game and allow you to start again.
Conclusion

Overall, we are pleased with the results of this exercise. We were able to create an engaging Tic Tac Toe game using AI-prompted engineering in just three hours. While there is always room for improvement, we believe that this game is a testament to the power of AI and engineering, and we hope that you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it.
